Text Based RPG

A Python-based RPG text adventure game meant to refresh my studies on CSCI 141 at RIT. Featuring character creation, turn-based combat, inventory management, quests, and persistent save/load functionality.

The game is meant to use: 
- Variables & Types	Game stats (HP, gold, inventory, level, etc.)
- Control Flow. Game logic: choices, conditionals, combat outcomes
- Loops	Repeating actions like traveling, fighting, shopping
- Functions	Actions like attack(), travel(), shop(), save_game()
- Lists & Dictionaries. Inventory system, player stats, map data, shop items
- File I/O. Saving/loading game progress using JSON or text
- OOP (Classes)	Player, Enemy, Item, Location, and Game classes
- Error Handling. Input validation, file errors, invalid choices
- Recursion + Navigating a maze or generating a dungeon map


Features:
- Character creation (name, class, stats)
- Movement between locations (text map or coordinates)
- Enemies to fight (turn-based combat system)
- Inventory and shop system
- Save/load game using file I/O
- Victory/end conditions

Installation:
Just have Python 3x. I used the latest version of Python at the time (3.15). Then Clone repository.
